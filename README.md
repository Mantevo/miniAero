# miniAero CFD Mini-Application

MiniAero is a mini-application for the evaulation of programming models and hardware for next generation platforms. MiniAero is an explicit (using RK4) unstructured finite volume code that solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Both inviscid and viscous terms are included. The viscous terms can be optionally included or excluded.
